/*Heartbeat 2.0 (Yay!!)
By Jack, Bonnie and Brytni April 4, 2018
This iteration of heartbeat design has the following assumptions:
1. This code is written from the perspective of OBC
   (Will generalize this code, to lib-common structure soon)
2. The triangular configuration of heartbeat is set as:
    OBC -> PAY (OBC sends state data to PAY) (PAY is the parent of OBC)
    PAY -> EPS (PAY sends state data to EPS)
    EPS -> OBC (EPS sends state data to OBC)
3. When there is a state update, a SSM needs to first update its own EEPROM,
   and then send the updated state data to its parent via CAN.
4. The state data transmits through CAN, is an array with size of uint8_t, and
     length of 3. state data stored in order in the array as OBC, PAY, EPS.
5. Error checking for state data is implemented (beta).
Other Note: This code is untested (but should work in theory)

Instructions
1. Tests extern increments
2. Does not go into loop if not fresh fresh_restart (test_heartbeat and test_heartbeat2)
3. test_10_beats to see if it really increments to 10 and stays that way on restart

TODO
1. Interrupt loop Bug
2. Masks for mobs
